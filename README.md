# Chris Anderson
Hi, my name is Chris.
I'm a student and software engineer studying in Boston, MA.

##### What I do
I have been working both independantly and collavoratively on software projects including web and mobile apps, some of which are public on GitHub.
##### Where I started
I began enjoying the challenge posed by technical problems in middle school, when I built my first computer. I have since rebuilt it countless times, overclocked it to it's limit, and have gone on to teach many of my friends how to build their own.
##### My secondary focus
I study Chinese language and culture. Taking classes since first grade, I have had the opportunity to visit China twice. I hope to keep improving, and learn more about the origins of the written characters.
